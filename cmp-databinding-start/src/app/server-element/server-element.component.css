/* We need to aply css options at component level - it will apply only at component scope (even if we put in app main css 
it won't apply to other components. Usually CSS applies to all elements by browser but angular creates uniuqe attribte for 
each component _ngcontent-c0 (_ngcontent-c1 and so on) and then that CSS aplies to that specific element with this HTML tag - so 
it is just feature of angular - it rewrites common/global CSS for this specific html elemtn e.g. :
p _ngcontent-c0 {
    color: blue;
  }
*/
p {
    color: blue;
  }
