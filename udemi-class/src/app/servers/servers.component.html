  Browser parse html and build DOM structure and propert of element is set up in specific dom element, this dom elemnt
  can contain a lot other properties which were not set up(and sometimes is not possible to set up by) HTML. When we
  doing Porperty Binding Angular attaches to this DOM elemtn attribute(property) value to dinamic value from component
-->
<!-- <button class="btn btn-primary" disabled>Add server</button> -->
<!--
  We can use string interpolation instead of property binding and vise versa but it is suggested just follow logic to use
  property binding for changing some properties of element wereas for showing some string info better use string interpolation
-->
<!--
  syntaxis is [property] = " typescript expresion ", {{ typescript expression }} - these expressions are not part of HTML!
  they are evaluted by Angular and it will extract and execute code of type script expressions. We also can't mix property
  binding with string interpolation - they work separatly but not one in another.
-->
<!--
  onclick="" typical  attributee on the HTML element but in angular we use our own syntaxis for events binding
  (any html event without on) = "typescript - usually method"
