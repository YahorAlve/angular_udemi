<!-- Each set of nested divs also span up to 12 columns of their parent div. 
     NOTE: Since each .col class has 15px padding on either side, you should usually wrap nested columns in a .row,
     which has -15px margins. This avoids duplicating the padding, and keeps the content lined up between nested 
     and non-nested col classes. -->
<div class="row">
  <!-- xs stands for extra small screens, 12 means span 12 available grids (only 12 is available in total).
     In short, they are used to define at which screen size that class should apply:
     xs = extra small screens (mobile phones)
     sm = small screens (tablets)
     md = medium screens (some desktops)
     lg = large screens (remaining desktops)
     You should usually classify a div using multiple column classes so it behaves differently depending 
     on the screen size (this is the heart of what makes bootstrap responsive). eg: a div with classes
     col-xs-6 and col-sm-4 will span half the screen on mobile phone (xs) and 1/3 of the screen on tablets(sm).
     
     NOTE: as per comment below, grid classes for a given screen size apply to that screen size and larger unless
     another declaration overrides it (i.e. col-xs-6 col-md-4 spans 6 columns on xs and sm, and 4 columns on md 
     and lg, even though sm and lg were never explicitly declared)

     NOTE: if you don't define xs, it will default to col-xs-12 (i.e. col-sm-6 is half the width on sm, 
     md and lg screens, but full-width on xs screens).

     NOTE: it's actually totally fine if your .row includes more than 12 cols, as long as you are aware of 
     how they will react. --This is a contentious issue, and not everyone agrees.
